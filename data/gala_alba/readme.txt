This annotated dataset comes from the Environmental Data Automated Track Annotation System (Env-DATA) on Movebank (movebank.org). The environmental data attributes are created and distributed by government and research organizations. For general information on the Env-DATA System, see Dodge et al. (2013) and movebank.org/node/6607.
